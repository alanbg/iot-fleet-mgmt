Project coverage:

Experience with RPM-based Linux	✅
	- You're working on Fedora/RHEL-like systems, building and installing .rpm packages, using dnf, rpm-build, and systemd.

Solid C/C++/Python/OOP knowledge	✅
	- Writing the agent in modern C++, optionally modularized into classes; writing Python client tools; practicing structured code design.

Shell scripting knowledge	✅
	- You’ll use Bash for deployment, logging, system queries (e.g., Docker ps, df, free), and managing services.

Experience with Linux software package management systems	✅
	- Using dnf, rpm, .spec files, repos`, and building local packages for deployment.

Understanding of cloud and container technologies	✅
	- Agent gathers metrics on running containers (Docker), and could be extended to monitor Kubernetes or container health.

Open-source development experience	✅
	- You’ll be creating a cleanly structured, CMake-based open source project, with README, spec, service files, etc. — the kind of real-world repo found on GitHub.
